# Idea
Build a live server where anyone in anywhere in the world can join to code on the same document that you are coding.

### Why?
It's a test to see what we can build with the help of many people that don't know each other and have the same rights to write, erase, copy and paste.

### What runs underneaf?
Currently only the text is stored and sent directly to the iframe.

### Plans to run
- [x] HTML/CSS
- [ ] Javascript
- [ ] Node

### To do list
- [ ] Make a room for webcoding
- [ ] Adjust the layout
- [ ] Manage to actually create web sockets for the fun of the project

### Inspirations/Tools
- React-bash
